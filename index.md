[News & Updates](#updates)

I am Md Mofijul (Akash) Islam, PhD student, University of Virginia. I am an ESE-UVA Bicentennial Fellow (2019-2020). I am working at the [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab-0) with [Prof. Tariq Iqbal](http://www.tiqbal.com/). Previously I was working as a Lecturer at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka](http://cse.du.ac.bd/). I completed M.S. and B.Sc(Hons) in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka](http://cse.du.ac.bd/).

My research interest broadly lies at the intersection of multimodal and multi-task learning, self-supervised learning, and Human-Centered AI. Recently I started to explore human/animal multisensory systems from a neuroscience perspective to design multimodal learning approaches.

I love to write code with background music and participate in hackathons, programming, and software contests. During my free time, I like to travel to new places.
