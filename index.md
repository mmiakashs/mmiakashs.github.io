[News & Updates](#updates)

I am Md. Mofijul Islam, currently working as a Lecturer at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka](http://cse.du.ac.bd/). I completed M.S. and B.Sc(Hons) in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka](http://cse.du.ac.bd/).

My research interest broadly lies at the intersection of theoretical and practical machine learning to solve real world problems. Specifically, I am interested in working on research problems which are related to machine learning, transfer learning, optimization, graphical probabilistic models, and interpretable ML.

I love to write code with background music and participate in hackathons, programming and software contests. During my free time, I like to travel new places.
