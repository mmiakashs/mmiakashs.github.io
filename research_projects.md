## Multi-modal and Multi-task Learning
  Details will be updated later.

## Design Optimization and Evolutionary Approches
The aim of this project is to design optimization and evolutionary approches to solve NP-Complete problems in various domains, such as resource allocation in cloud computing environment and reduce overfiting issue as well as improve the reasoning process in learning models.
  * ### Resource Allocation in Mobile Cloud Computing
  In this project, we utilized two evolutionary approches, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization(specifically Ant Colony Optimization) to design two resource allocation schemes in heterogeneous Mobile Cloud Computing(MCC) environment. These meta-heuristics resource allocation approches helps to minimizes the task execution and subsequently increase resource utilization in MCC, which is very crucial for Big data based resource constrained cloud application, such as mobile and e-health application.

    **Outcome:** [IEEE Access 2017](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7933943/),[NSysS 2016](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7400696)
  * ### Reduce Overfiting Problem in Deep Learning Models
  We are currently working with some evolutionary approches to reduce the overfiting problem in deep learing problem, as till now most of the effective solution of overfiting problem is not guided approach.

  * ### Optimized Distributed Clustering Model in DSN
  We developed dynamic distributed clustering model to minimizes energy consumption and data collection time in directional sensor network(DSN) by minizing the active directional sensor nodes. Our clustering approches is showed effective performance to increase the network lifetime in DSN.

    **Outcome:** [EURASIP JWCN 2015](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13638-015-0394-2),[IEEE APWiMob 2014](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6920259/)

## Natural Language Processing
Currently, we are working with the Bangla language in developing the computationally linguistic model and comprehensive datasets. A few works address Bangla language, due to the complexity of this language and scarccity of the datasets.

  * ### Transfer Learning Approach to Extract Fact and Validate Statement
  In recent years, with the proliferation of social media, validating statement apprears as a crucial problem and attract the attention of NLP research communities. However, due to the lack of any comprehensive dataset, NLP communities could not address this problems effectively. That's why in this work, we are utilizing the transfer learning approach to develop a fact extraction and checking models with the few available dataset.

    **Outcome:**[Manuscript in Preparation]

  * ### Bangla Article Classfication
  We curated a comprehensive dataset of Bangla news articles, which contains around 400,000 news articles collected from different Bangla News portals. We also develop Bangla articles classification model with semantic textual features, which outperforms state-of-art-works. Moreover, we have also plan to extend this dataset, so that we can address other Bangla NLP reserach problems.

    **Outcome:** ICBSLP 2018[[Dataset and Source Code](https://github.com/tanvirfahim15/BARD-Bangla-Article-Classifier), [Web Application](http://bard2018.pythonanywhere.com/)]
  * ### Bangla Speech and Speakers Identification
  Presently, in this work, we are developing a Bangla speech dataset so that researchers can develop various computational learning models, such as Bangla voice recognition, speakers identification etc. Till now, there is no public Bangla speech dataset avaiable for research purpose.

    **Outcome:** [Data Collection Application](http://banglawordlearner.firebaseapp.com)

## Computational Biology
In this research project, we are working with domain experts to develop learning model to solve various Bio-Informatics related problems.

  * ###  iProtGly-SS: Identifying Protein Lysine Glycation Sites
  Glycation is chemical reaction by which sugar molecule bonds with a protein without the help of enzymes. This is often cause to many diseases and therefore the knowledge about glycation is very important. In this work, we designed a supervised learning model, iProtGly-SS, to identify protein lysine glycation site based on features extracted from sequence and secondary structural information.

    **Outcome:** [Proteins Journal 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29675975) [[Source Code, Data, Web Application](http://brl.uiu.ac.bd/iprotgly-ss/)]
